    <h1>Ode to My One True Love, My Dingus</h1>
    <hr>
    <p> In a world of chaos, wild and free,
        You came along, my dingus bee.
        With quirks that make the stars align,
        You're wholly yours — no halfway sign.

        Your laugh is mischief, soft and bright,
        A spark that turns my dark to light.
        You dance through life with clumsy grace,
        A warm, weird sun in homely face.

        You're pie at midnight, socks unmatched,
        The kind of joy that can't be batched.
        You hum old tunes off-key with pride,
        And still insist you’re “kinda shy.”

        My dingus dear, my wayward spark,
        You trip on rugs but call it art.
        You hug too hard and speak your mind,
        But somehow leave the best ones blind—

        Blind to reason, lost in bliss,
        Because loving you feels like this:
        A little odd, a little strange,
        But beautiful beyond all change.

        So here’s to us — the mismatched,
        The fools who found what once was missed.
        No crown fits you, yet still you reign—
        My one and only, quirky pain.

        Forever dinging through my soul,
        You're more than just a passing role.
        You're my forever kind of "thing"—
        My one true love, my dingus king.</p>
